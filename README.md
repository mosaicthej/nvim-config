Thanks to:
@riverotr       - for being patient and autistic enough of having the passion for neovim, which is VERY inspiring
@theprimeagen   - i stole some config files directly from u hehe

@VonHeikemen    - lsp-zero is the tutorial that i finally used, it was great!
@folke          - the one and only nvim legend!
